# TODO

## Good to mention the crew, nice cliff hanger.

name your ship
1 crew member wakes up
forced interaction

2 more wakes up
choose interaction

The rest wakes up,
you know what to do and you're familiar with the "controls"

## Other Things Not Yet Implemented

- Ticks
- Multiple narratives
- Probes
- Selecting crew members to assist with probes
- Make region names 'confirmable' so that users can provide their own names if desired
- Improve saved game loading so it 'picks back up' where you left off, if in the middle of something like the intro sequence
