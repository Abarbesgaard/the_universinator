# TODO

## Good to mention the crew, nice cliff hanger.

[x] name yourself
[x] name your ship
[x] science officer wakes up
[x] scan system
[ ] engineering and medical officers wake up
[ ] display system info OR scan a planet
[ ] tactical officer wakes up
[ ] perform whichever action you didn't do the first time

## Other Things Not Yet Implemented

- Ticks
- Multiple narratives
- Probes
- display sysinfo_name-of-system OR display sysinfo_system_id (if shown/known)
- Selecting crew members to assist with probes
- Make region names 'confirmable' so that users can provide their own names if desired
- Improve saved game loading so it 'picks back up' where you left off, if in the middle of something like the intro sequence
